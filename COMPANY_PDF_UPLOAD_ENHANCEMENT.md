# Company-Based PDF Upload Enhancement

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Frontend Enhancements (`client/src/features/PDFUpload/PDFUpload.jsx`)

#### 1. Company Selection UI
- **Company Selection Section**: Added prominent company selector at the top of the upload page
- **Visual Indicators**: Company selection shows default company badges and building icons
- **Upload Gating**: Users must select a company before uploading files
- **Company Display**: Each uploaded file shows which company it belongs to

#### 2. User Experience Improvements
- **Disabled State**: Upload area is disabled until company is selected
- **Clear Messaging**: Instructions updated to emphasize company selection first
- **Visual Feedback**: Upload area changes appearance based on company selection status
- **Company Context**: File list shows company information for each uploaded PDF

#### 3. Data Flow
- **Company Validation**: Prevents upload if no company is selected
- **Company Data**: Passes both `companyId` and `companyName` to backend
- **State Management**: Tracks selected company throughout upload process

### Backend Enhancements (`server/controllers/realPdfController.js`)

#### 1. Upload Processing
- **Company Data Capture**: Accepts `companyId` and `companyName` in upload request
- **Metadata Storage**: Saves company information to both upload record and metadata file
- **Logging**: Logs which company PDFs are being uploaded for

#### 2. Transaction Creation
- **Company Assignment**: All transactions automatically get assigned to the selected company
- **Metadata Reading**: Reads company info from metadata file during processing
- **Database Fields**: Populates `companyId` and `companyName` fields on transactions

#### 3. Response Enhancement
- **Company Echo**: Returns company information in upload response
- **Consistency**: Ensures frontend and backend have matching company data

### User Workflow

```
1. User navigates to PDF Upload page
2. User selects a company from dropdown
3. Upload area becomes enabled and shows company context
4. User drags/drops or selects PDF files
5. Files upload with company information attached
6. All transactions from PDF are automatically assigned to selected company
7. File list shows company association for each PDF
```

### Data Model Updates

#### Upload Record
```javascript
{
  id: "upload-uuid",
  fileName: "statement.pdf",
  companyId: "company-uuid",     // NEW
  companyName: "Acme Corp",      // NEW
  uploadedBy: "user-uuid",
  uploadedAt: "2025-07-05T...",
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Transaction Record
```javascript
{
  id: "transaction-uuid",
  description: "Payment received",
  amount: 1500.00,
  companyId: "company-uuid",     // AUTO-ASSIGNED
  companyName: "Acme Corp",      // AUTO-ASSIGNED
  sourceFileId: "upload-uuid",
  // ... other fields
}
```
