# Upload Edit/Rename Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Identified ✅
The edit functionality was showing only a "quick flash" and not opening the edit window properly.

### Root Cause:
The **global `isRenaming` state** was interfering with individual upload editing:

1. ❌ Edit button was disabled when ANY upload was being renamed globally
2. ❌ Save button was disabled by global rename state  
3. ❌ Complex useEffect was clearing editing state prematurely
4. ❌ State management was too tightly coupled between global and local states

### The Fix Applied:

#### 1. Simplified State Management
**File: `client/src/features/Uploads/UploadList.jsx`**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Edit button disabled by global state
disabled={editingId === upload.id || isRenaming}

// Complex useEffect clearing state prematurely
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isRenaming && editingId) {
    setEditingId(null);
    setEditName('');
  }
}, [isRenaming, editingId]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Edit button only disabled for the specific upload being edited
disabled={editingId === upload.id}

// Simplified - no complex useEffect
// Clear state immediately after save action
```

#### 2. Per-Upload State Management
- ✅ Each upload can be edited independently
- ✅ Global `isRenaming` doesn't block other uploads from being edited
- ✅ Editing state clears immediately after save/cancel
- ✅ No interference between different upload operations

#### 3. Improved User Experience
- ✅ Edit button always clickable (unless that specific upload is being edited)
- ✅ Save button always functional
- ✅ Clean state transitions
- ✅ No "quick flash" issues

### Expected Behavior Now:
1. ✅ Click edit (pencil icon) → Edit field appears immediately
2. ✅ Type new name → Changes reflected in input
3. ✅ Press Enter or click ✓ → Name saves and edit mode closes
4. ✅ Press Escape or click ✕ → Edit mode cancels
5. ✅ Multiple uploads can be edited without interference

### Additional Cleanup:
- 🧹 Removed debug console logs from upload management
- 🧹 Cleaned up unnecessary debug buttons
- 🧹 Simplified component structure

**Status: RESOLVED** 🎉
The edit functionality should now work smoothly without the "quick flash" issue.
