# PDF Upload Navigation Debug Test

## Test Instructions

1. **Navigate to the PDF Upload Page** (`/upload`)
2. **Look for Debug Elements:**
   - Red debug section with "Test Navigate to Companies" button
   - Alternative "Create Your First Company" button below the company selector
   - Original company selector dropdown

3. **Test Each Button:**
   - Click the red "Test Navigate to Companies" button
   - Try opening the company selector dropdown and look for create buttons
   - Click the alternative "Create Your First Company" button

4. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for debug messages starting with 🔍
   - Check for any error messages
   - Verify navigation attempts

## Expected Debug Output

When clicking buttons, you should see console messages like:
```
🔍 Direct navigation test button clicked
🔍 Direct navigation successful
🔍 Create company button clicked!
🔍 Navigate function: function
🔍 Navigation attempted to /companies
```

## Expected Behavior

- All buttons should navigate to `/companies` (Company Management page)
- Toast notifications should appear
- No console errors should occur
- The Company Management page should load properly

## Debugging Steps

If navigation doesn't work:
1. Check if `/companies` route exists in React Router
2. Verify `useNavigate` hook is working
3. Check for JavaScript errors in console
4. Verify CompanyManagement component imports correctly

## Cleanup

After testing, remove the debug elements:
- Remove red debug section
- Remove alternative button
- Remove console.log statements
- Keep the working navigation code
