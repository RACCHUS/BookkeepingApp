## Upload Delete Issue - Debugging Summary

### Problem
Uploads are being deleted from the backend successfully, but the frontend UI still shows them as present after deletion.

### Implemented Fixes

1. **Enhanced Delete Mutation with Optimistic Updates**
   - Added immediate cache update to remove the deleted upload from the UI
   - Changed from `invalidateQueries` to `refetchQueries` for more aggressive cache refresh
   - Added debug logging to track the deletion process

2. **Improved Cache Management**
   - Optimistically remove upload from cache before server confirmation
   - Force refetch all upload queries to ensure consistency
   - Better handling of selected upload state when deleted upload was selected

3. **Enhanced UI Feedback**
   - Added loading spinner on delete button during deletion
   - Proper disabled state management
   - Better visual feedback for user

### Debug Console Logs Added
When testing deletion, check browser console for:
- "Starting delete mutation for: [uploadId]"
- "Delete mutation successful for: [uploadId]"
- "Updating cache, removing upload: [uploadId]"
- "Old data length: X, New data length: Y"

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User clicks delete button and confirms
2. Button shows loading spinner and is disabled
3. Upload is immediately removed from UI (optimistic update)
4. Backend deletion completes
5. Cache is refreshed to ensure consistency
6. If deleted upload was selected, details panel closes

### Test Steps
1. Go to Uploads page
2. Find an upload to delete
3. Click delete (trash icon)
4. Confirm deletion in dialog
5. Verify upload disappears immediately from list
6. Check console for debug logs
7. Refresh page to verify it's actually deleted from backend

### Next Steps
- Test the functionality
- If working correctly, remove debug console.log statements
- Monitor for any remaining edge cases
